# Zincore: Refined ChIP-seq peak analysis and discovery of additional zinc-finger proteins

Code related to the publication: "**Zincore, an atypical coactivator complex that controls zinc finger transcription factors**". (manuscript in preparation)

This repository consists of scripts organized in three main sections:
1. **Refined peaks**: Tools for finding summits within called peaks from Zincore ChIP-seq data.
2. **ChIP overlaps**: Tools for discovery of associated transcription factors through comparison with public human ChIP-seq datasets.
3. **Motif discovery**: Tools for finding enriched DNA binding motifs within Zincore ChIP-seq peaks.
