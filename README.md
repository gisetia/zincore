# Zincore: Refined peak analysis and discovery of additional ZNFs

Code related to the publication: "**Zincore, an atypical coactivator complex that controls zinc finger transcription factors**". (manuscript in preparation)

The repository consists of scripts organized in three main sections:
1. **Refined peaks**: Tools for finding summits within called peaks from Zincore ChIP-seq data.
2. **ChIP overlaps**: Tools for discovery of associated transcription factors through comparison with public human ChIP-seq datasets.
3. **Motif discovery**: Tools for finding enriched DNA binding motifs within Zincore ChIP-seq peaks.

* Python 3.8.2
* Python libraries in `python_requirements.txt` file
* R 4.2.0
    * DiffBind 3.6.5
    * ChIPseeker 1.32.1
* meme 5.5.0 (??)
